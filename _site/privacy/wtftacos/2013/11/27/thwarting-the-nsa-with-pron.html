So today's major story is about how the NSA has been monitoring the porn habits of "radicals" in an attempt to later use that information to discredit them. This got me thinking of stenography (a.k.a hiding files inside of other files) what if we filled all the porn pictures recursively with the same picture. To a degree in where all pictures would increase in size to a point where your browser could handle 1 or 2 at a time. But with the amount of data that the NSA seems to be siphoning it would cause a major impact on their analytic capabilities.

We could even take this a step further. What if we filled all porn images with NSFW images like Goatse (do not Google this unless you are willing to bleach your eyes) and Tubgirl (NSFW do not Google this unless you are willing to scrub your eyeballs with steel wool)? The NSA would be forced to deep dive into the images because they have to see whats inside. Then of course the vomiting would begin.
