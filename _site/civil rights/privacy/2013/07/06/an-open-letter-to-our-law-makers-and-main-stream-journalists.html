          <h2>An open letter to our Law Makers and Main Stream Journalists</h2>
<p class="meta">06 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
When the news first broke that our government was engaged in a massive surveillance effort to collect as much information as possible on as many Americans as possible, I at first felt a small sense of smug satisfaction. For months I as well as <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/exclusive_national_security_agency_whistleblower_william" target="_blank">many</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ioerror" target="_blank">many</a> others have been telling anyone who would listen that our own government was spying on us, invading our privacy, and violating our rights. Most of what was leaked was strongly suspected by many vocal individuals for months. Some listened, some didn't. Back in January I began to organize a local CryptoParty to raise awareness of the NSA activities and to teach anyone tools and techniques to protect their data and identities online.

Now what was once smug satisfaction has turned into anger. I hear our law makers try to downplay the scope of the spy programs and trivialize the impact. They claim that its "just metadata" well with "just metadata" I can tell where you've been, when you were there, who you were communicating with, for how long the communication lasted and who you associate with. With "just metadata" I can build maps of your associations and their associations and determine your likely political/social alliances. With "just metadata" I don't care what you were communicating to the other person because that generally isn't as important as the information gained from the metadata itself.

The other thing that I am starting to hear is law makers making the claim that these leaks have made us less safe because now the "bad guys" are now aware of what our peeping tom government is doing and are changing their ways. This is just plain wrong. Like I said before many people have known for months about US Government spy programs. Myself as well as many others have taken to other means of communication, encrypted and anonymous, to protect communications from prying eyes. And there is no reason to believe that the "bad guys" have been doing anything different. People like William Binney have been telling everyone for months now that the NSA is intercepting communications on a massive scale. A few brave Senators like Senator Wyden have made mention that there exists a secret set of laws that the federal government uses. Journalists like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/glenn-greenwald" target="_blank">Glenn Greenwald</a>, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/authors/jeremy-scahill#" target="_blank">Jeremy Scahill</a>, and <a href="http://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank">Julian Assange</a> have been warning us of US Government overreach. Do Law Makers really naively believe that the "bad guys" aren't listening? Or are they upset that they have been outed and are doing damage control to minimize the public outcry because they need to eventually get re-elected.

The only thing that the leaks have done is confirm what we already knew, verify that maybe we weren't so unjustified in wearing a tin-foil hat, and finally lift the last veil of skepticism from the eyes of the average person.
