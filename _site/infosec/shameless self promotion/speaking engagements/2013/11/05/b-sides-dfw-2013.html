Another year and another B-Sides DFW has come to pass. This year once again the organizers of B-Sides DFW outdid themselves. Great talks were given, knowledge was accumulated, and friendships were born. I as well as many others had a great time. I am proud to have been a part of such an amazing event. Thanks to the organizers, volunteers, and sponsors that made it happen, thanks for letting me speak at the event and thanks to all those who attended.
