      <p><p>Back in 2009 I was living in California. My wife and I had just had our first child and I had gotten laid off from an Aerospace company I had been working at. I commuted through a mountain pass every day to get to work. It was a really nice drive through scenic forested mountains. And there was this little gift shop that was barely more than a shack about halfway through the pass. There was a sign on the side of the building that said &quot;Sandwiches and Cold Drinks&quot; and I would think to myself when I drove by that I should stop by someday and try their sandwiches and get a cold drink. I passed it every day for years but never stopped. I was always on my way to work and didn&#39;t have time to stop, or I was on my way home from work and was too tired to stop.</p>

      <a href="/privacy/wtftacos/2013/11/27/thwarting-the-nsa-with-pron.html">Thwarting the NSA with Pron!</a></h4>
      <p>So today's major story is about how the NSA has been monitoring the porn habits of "radicals" in an attempt to later use that information to discredit them. This got me thinking of stenography (a.k.a hiding files inside of other files) what if we filled all the porn pictures recursively with the same picture. To a degree in where all pictures would increase in size to a point where your browser could handle 1 or 2 at a time. But with the amount of data that the NSA seems to be siphoning it would cause a major impact on their analytic capabilities.

We could even take this a step further. What if we filled all porn images with NSFW images like Goatse (do not Google this unless you are willing to bleach your eyes) and Tubgirl (NSFW do not Google this unless you are willing to scrub your eyeballs with steel wool)? The NSA would be forced to deep dive into the images because they have to see whats inside. Then of course the vomiting would begin.

Improving Enterprises in Addison, TX.
16633 Dallas Pkwy #100  Addison, TX 75001

This month we will be talking about TrueCrypt. We will talk about Whole Disk Encryption, Creating Encrypted Containers, and plausible deniability.  Bring your laptops and questions. There will be a brief overview and a live demo. As always it is free. Food and drink will be provided.

Also sorry for the lack of updates. CryptoParty DFW is not dead and is continuing as normal. A virulent strain of stomach bug has swept through my home resulting in members of my household being alternatively sick or caring for the sick. Also I traveled to Memphis to speak at B-Sides Memphis on the topic of OPSEC for Mobile. In addition to still recovering from the stomach bug I got a bad case of stage fright and bombed my talk. There will be video up later and I hope that in my nervous ramblings somebody is able to learn something and improve their privacy and security.

In addition I will be speaking at B-Sides DFW. My talk will be "Counter-Culture and Tin Foil Hats in the CyberPunk Age" where I will be talking about Activism in the age of the surveillance state. There are still a few seats left at the time of this post so get your tickets now. There is also a Friday night event that will include firetalks and a resume workshop where you can meet with technical recruiters who can help you refine your Resume and "Elevator Pitch".
Details here: <a href="http://www.bsidesdfw.com/" target="_blank">http://www.bsidesdfw.com/</a>

And finally I am working on video how-to's on installing and using various privacy products. GPG, Tor, and TrueCrypt. I started on the first one and work is progressing slowly but it is progressing. I will post more about it when I have more.

      <a href="/civil%20rights/privacy/2013/07/06/an-open-letter-to-our-law-makers-and-main-stream-journalists.html">An open letter to our Law Makers and Main Stream Journalists</a></h4>
      <p>When the news first broke that our government was engaged in a massive surveillance effort to collect as much information as possible on as many Americans as possible, I at first felt a small sense of smug satisfaction. For months I as well as <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/exclusive_national_security_agency_whistleblower_william" target="_blank">many</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ioerror" target="_blank">many</a> others have been telling anyone who would listen that our own government was spying on us, invading our privacy, and violating our rights. Most of what was leaked was strongly suspected by many vocal individuals for months. Some listened, some didn't. Back in January I began to organize a local CryptoParty to raise awareness of the NSA activities and to teach anyone tools and techniques to protect their data and identities online.

Now what was once smug satisfaction has turned into anger. I hear our law makers try to downplay the scope of the spy programs and trivialize the impact. They claim that its "just metadata" well with "just metadata" I can tell where you've been, when you were there, who you were communicating with, for how long the communication lasted and who you associate with. With "just metadata" I can build maps of your associations and their associations and determine your likely political/social alliances. With "just metadata" I don't care what you were communicating to the other person because that generally isn't as important as the information gained from the metadata itself.

The other thing that I am starting to hear is law makers making the claim that these leaks have made us less safe because now the "bad guys" are now aware of what our peeping tom government is doing and are changing their ways. This is just plain wrong. Like I said before many people have known for months about US Government spy programs. Myself as well as many others have taken to other means of communication, encrypted and anonymous, to protect communications from prying eyes. And there is no reason to believe that the "bad guys" have been doing anything different. People like William Binney have been telling everyone for months now that the NSA is intercepting communications on a massive scale. A few brave Senators like Senator Wyden have made mention that there exists a secret set of laws that the federal government uses. Journalists like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/glenn-greenwald" target="_blank">Glenn Greenwald</a>, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/authors/jeremy-scahill#" target="_blank">Jeremy Scahill</a>, and <a href="http://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank">Julian Assange</a> have been warning us of US Government overreach. Do Law Makers really naively believe that the "bad guys" aren't listening? Or are they upset that they have been outed and are doing damage control to minimize the public outcry because they need to eventually get re-elected.

The only thing that the leaks have done is confirm what we already knew, verify that maybe we weren't so unjustified in wearing a tin-foil hat, and finally lift the last veil of skepticism from the eyes of the average person.

      <a href="/2013/04/04/apple-imessage-proves-tough-for-feds-to-intercept.html">Apple iMessage proves tough for Feds to intercept.</a></h4>
      <p>According to a <a title="Apple gets something right!" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57577887-38/apples-imessage-encryption-trips-up-feds-surveillance/" target="_blank">CNET article</a> feds are having trouble intercepting messages sent with Apple's iMessage service. iMessage is a text messaging service on Apple devices that appears on all iOS devices and new versions of the Apple Desktop OS. Most iOS users have used this on many occasions without realizing it. iMessage integrates seamlessly with the standard SMS services, and intelligently routes messages over iMessage if the device its sending to is iMessage capable (other iOS devices, newer versions of Apple OS X) and connected via WiFi.

From the article the DEA has made the claim that "it is impossible to intercept iMessages between two Apple devices" even with a court order.

If you read between the lines here the implication is that the DEA has made attempts to intercept communications without a court order.

But before you throw your Android Phone in the trash remember that iMessage only works between two iMessage enabled Apple devices that both MUST be connected to the internet via WiFi (or a wired connection in the case of OS X) and not just 3G or 4G cellular internet. If your recipient does not meet all these criteria iMessage defaults to a standard SMS text message which is not secure at all.

In any case it is better to use an <a title="OTR Chat" href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/" target="_blank">OTR</a> chat client to send sensitive messages.

<strong>UPDATE 2013-04-08:
</strong>

Several people have reminded me that this only stops LEO (Law Enforcement Organizations) from capturing the data off-the-wire. A subpoena to Apple can still be used to gain access to the encrypted messages. It is also possible to crack the encryption though I am not sure how difficult this would be since I don't know a lot about the about the encryption methods employed by Apple to store the messages.
