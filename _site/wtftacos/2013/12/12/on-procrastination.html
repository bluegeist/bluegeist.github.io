      <h2>On Procrastination</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Dec 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Back in 2009 I was living in California. My wife and I had just had our first child and I had gotten laid off from an Aerospace company I had been working at. I commuted through a mountain pass every day to get to work. It was a really nice drive through scenic forested mountains. And there was this little gift shop that was barely more than a shack about halfway through the pass. There was a sign on the side of the building that said &quot;Sandwiches and Cold Drinks&quot; and I would think to myself when I drove by that I should stop by someday and try their sandwiches and get a cold drink. I passed it every day for years but never stopped. I was always on my way to work and didn&#39;t have time to stop, or I was on my way home from work and was too tired to stop.</p>

<p>Anyways when I got layed off I took a job with a Driving School. Hated it. My wife&#39;s family had all been slowly moving one by one out to Texas and were trying to convince us to come out as well. We were being indecisive, we didn&#39;t really know anybody out there, I wasn&#39;t a big fan of being surrounded by my in-laws, and I had lived most of my life in Los Angeles and wasn&#39;t ready to go. But with the economy tanking it wasn&#39;t looking good.</p>

<p>Then in the late Summer of 2009 terrible fires decimated the forests that I used to commute through. They raged for weeks and were among the worst wildfires in Southern California history. People died, homes were destroyed, and ash rained down all over the county for weeks. If you drove into the San Fernando Valley at night you could see by the glow of the fires in the surrounding mountains. It was like living in a scene from Dante&#39;s Inferno. It was surreal.</p>

<p>The mountain roads were closed for months while repairs were made. I continued to talk with my wife about moving to Texas, continued to teach snot nosed 15 year olds how to drive, continued to hate my life. Finally in the winter the mountain pass roads opened back up and I decided to take a drive and see how bad the fire was. It was awful. Where dense thickets of trees had been were now charred stumps. The fire had been so bad that the little plastic reflectors in the road that help you identify the lanes at night had melted. The asphalt had been burned and melted and had to be torn out and replaced.</p>

<p>Worst of all though was that the gift shop was gone. And by gone I mean GONE. There was nothing left. Not even a concrete pad where it used to be. The fire had so completely cleansed the area that if you didn&#39;t know about the gift shop before hand you would never be able to tell that it had existed. Outside of the mysterious owners of the gift shop I felt that I was maybe the only other person to know that it had once existed.</p>

<p>It was time to stop talking about doing things and start doing them. I had talked about stopping at that stupid gift shop and buying a sandwich and a drink for years and never did. Now I would never be able to. Sure the sandwich was probably going to be over priced, sure it probably wouldn&#39;t have been that good. But now something I had been considering doing, something I wanted to do was gone forever. I had to stop talking about doing things and do them.</p>

<p>&quot;Fortune favors the bold&quot;</p>

<p>I turned around and drove home. I went upstairs and told my wife we were moving to Texas. It was time to stop talking about doing things and do them. Within a few weeks she was on a plane to Texas with my daughter. A couple of weeks later I had spent the last few dollars I had left in the world renting a Uhaul and loading everything I owned into it. Within a few weeks of being in Texas I had an IT job (my chosen profession) and a nice apartment. I have no regrets.</p>
