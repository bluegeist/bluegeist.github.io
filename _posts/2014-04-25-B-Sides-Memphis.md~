B-Sides Memphis is approaching their 3rd year and they are struggling to get people to submit talks. They have just under a month left until they close their CFP. Last I checked they only had gotten 3 submissions. I already volunteered to talk if they need me to, but I generally go on Dale Gribble style anti-government rants and will probably drive people away :)

B-Sides Memphis isn't a huge con but it is very much in the spirit of B-Sides. One of the best Information Gathering talks I've seen was given last year (by a Private Investigator). Its a one track cozy conference that gives me kind of a day long DC214 vibe where its an informal group of people that are just there to talk and learn.

Please consider submitting. You can drive there in a few hours. Hell you can take the Greyhound for $50. Southwest is offering flights for less than $150 right now if you don't want to drive. I'm sure we could even get a carpool going if we wanted to.

Last year they bought the Speakers Dinner at one of the best Memphis BBQ places around and had lunch catered by the other one that was considered the best. The after party was held down near Beale street at a hotel and fun was had by all.

I BS'd with Jack Daniel and a bunch of the other speakers for a few hours afterwards and had a great time.

Anyways I will be going and I encourage you all to go too. Even if you don't submit a talk (which you should) you should go.
