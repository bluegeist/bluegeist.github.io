According to a <a title="Apple gets something right!" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57577887-38/apples-imessage-encryption-trips-up-feds-surveillance/" target="_blank">CNET article</a> feds are having trouble intercepting messages sent with Apple's iMessage service. iMessage is a text messaging service on Apple devices that appears on all iOS devices and new versions of the Apple Desktop OS. Most iOS users have used this on many occasions without realizing it. iMessage integrates seamlessly with the standard SMS services, and intelligently routes messages over iMessage if the device its sending to is iMessage capable (other iOS devices, newer versions of Apple OS X) and connected via WiFi.

From the article the DEA has made the claim that "it is impossible to intercept iMessages between two Apple devices" even with a court order.

If you read between the lines here the implication is that the DEA has made attempts to intercept communications without a court order.

But before you throw your Android Phone in the trash remember that iMessage only works between two iMessage enabled Apple devices that both MUST be connected to the internet via WiFi (or a wired connection in the case of OS X) and not just 3G or 4G cellular internet. If your recipient does not meet all these criteria iMessage defaults to a standard SMS text message which is not secure at all.

In any case it is better to use an <a title="OTR Chat" href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/" target="_blank">OTR</a> chat client to send sensitive messages.

<strong>UPDATE 2013-04-08:
</strong>

Several people have reminded me that this only stops LEO (Law Enforcement Organizations) from capturing the data off-the-wire. A subpoena to Apple can still be used to gain access to the encrypted messages. It is also possible to crack the encryption though I am not sure how difficult this would be since I don't know a lot about the about the encryption methods employed by Apple to store the messages.
