This month we will be talking about Bitcoin!

Bitcoin is a semi-anonymous decentralized virtual currency. Our speaker will have a class on Bitcoin and as always we will stay after class to help anybody who has questions or needs assistance with any privacy related subject.

&nbsp;

CryptoParty DFW is held the 3rd Thursday of the month at 7 PM at

Improving Enterprises
16633 Dallas Pkwy #100  Addison, TX 75001
Food and drinks will be provided. BYOB.

*****THE DOOR MAY BE LOCKED*****

The business that hosts us closes at 5PM, but there is a guard that comes by on tour several times per hour and will open the door. One of the organizers will be checking the door on a regular basis as well so please do not be discouraged by a locked door.

Even though it isn’t required please consider an RSVP if you plan to attend so that I can get an accurate headcount for food. You can RSVP through either <a title="CryptoParty DFW Eventbrite" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cryptoparty-dfw-tickets-6480317805" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/scottjosh" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or email me at josh [at] wtftacos [dot] com
