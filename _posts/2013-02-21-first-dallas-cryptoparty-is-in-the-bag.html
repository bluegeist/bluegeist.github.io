So the first Dallas CryptoParty was held tonight at the Dallas MakerSpace. We had about 15 people that attended. It was the first one for the Dallas area and although the Demo Gods did not smile on us for a part of the demo it was overall a good time. I am uploading copies of the slides, as with everything I load on the site it is free to download, re-use, and distribute.
