CryptoPartyDFW 9/19 7PM at
Improving Enterprises in Addison, TX.
16633 Dallas Pkwy #100  Addison, TX 75001

This month we will be talking about TrueCrypt. We will talk about Whole Disk Encryption, Creating Encrypted Containers, and plausible deniability.  Bring your laptops and questions. There will be a brief overview and a live demo. As always it is free. Food and drink will be provided.

Also sorry for the lack of updates. CryptoParty DFW is not dead and is continuing as normal. A virulent strain of stomach bug has swept through my home resulting in members of my household being alternatively sick or caring for the sick. Also I traveled to Memphis to speak at B-Sides Memphis on the topic of OPSEC for Mobile. In addition to still recovering from the stomach bug I got a bad case of stage fright and bombed my talk. There will be video up later and I hope that in my nervous ramblings somebody is able to learn something and improve their privacy and security.

In addition I will be speaking at B-Sides DFW. My talk will be "Counter-Culture and Tin Foil Hats in the CyberPunk Age" where I will be talking about Activism in the age of the surveillance state. There are still a few seats left at the time of this post so get your tickets now. There is also a Friday night event that will include firetalks and a resume workshop where you can meet with technical recruiters who can help you refine your Resume and "Elevator Pitch".

And finally I am working on video how-to's on installing and using various privacy products. GPG, Tor, and TrueCrypt. I started on the first one and work is progressing slowly but it is progressing. I will post more about it when I have more.
