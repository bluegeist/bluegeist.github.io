The February CryptoParty will be held on February 20th, at 7 PM at Improving Enterprises in Addison, TX. This month will be a review of 4 of the most common tools taught at CryptoParty. Tor, TrueCrypt, PGP, and OTR. 

The class will have more emphasis on the hands on portions than on the lecture. Bring your laptops, cell phones, and questions. This will be a very interactive class, and attendees will get more benefit if they interact and ask questions.

Food and drinks will be provided. BYOB.

*****THE DOOR MAY BE LOCKED*****
The business that hosts us closes at 5PM, but there is a guard that comes by on tour several times per hour and will open the door. One of the organizers will be checking the door on a regular basis as well so please do not be discouraged by a locked door.

Even though it isnâ€™t required please consider an RSVP if you plan to attend so that I can get an accurate headcount for food. You can RSVP through either Eventbrite, Twitter, or email me at josh [at] wtftacos [dot] com
