This month's CryptoParty will be taught by local bearded ruffian [@Renegade0x6](https://twitter.com/Renegade0x6) Renegade will be giving a history of Cryptography and the differences between various types. As always CryptoParty is free to attend and open to anyone. Feel free to bring your laptops and questions. There will be food and drink and a handful of various computer security people willing and able to answer your questions.

Food and drinks will be provided. BYOB.

*****THE DOOR MAY BE LOCKED*****
The business that hosts us closes at 5PM, but there is a guard that comes by on tour several times per hour and will open the door. One of the organizers will be checking the door on a regular basis as well so please do not be discouraged by a locked door.

Even though it isnâ€™t required please consider an RSVP if you plan to attend so that I can get an accurate headcount for food. You can RSVP through either Eventbrite, Twitter, or email me at josh [at] wtftacos [dot] com
