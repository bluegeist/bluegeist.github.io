Hello everyone. CryptoParty is steadily growing in the DFW area. A few updates.
<ol>
	<li>cryptoparty.org is dead. It was victimized to death by spammers and has been replaced with cryptoparty.in which is in extreme beta stage.</li>
	<li>CryptoParty DFW has been slowly gaining momentum. Last month we had a great talk about anonymous blogging from <a href="http://twitter.com/kylemaxwell">@kylemaxwell</a> slides link <a href="https://t.co/e4Fkh50hBv" target="_blank">here </a></li>
</ol>
This month we will be covering email encryption with GPG. If enough people are interested we can do a keysigning party.

As always feel free to bring your laptops there will be food and drinks provided. BYOB.Â  It will be held on

July 18th 2013 7:00 PM at

16633 Dallas Parkway Suite 100 Addison, TX 75001

The doors are locked but a guard comes by on a tour and will let people in. Please be patient. I will be checking from time to time as well.

To help us determine how much food to order please register on <a href="http://cryptopartydfw.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">eventbrite</a>, email me josh@wtftacos.com, or twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/scottjosh">@scottjosh</a>

If you have any questions in the meantime or need help preparing for a sensitive action, event, or communication feel free to contact me any time.

See you there!
