This month we will be talking about... TrueCrypt (nobody saw this coming) Our own Kyle Maxwell has been researching and holding séances to try and determine what happened and what alternatives exist. Come on down, bring your laptops and questions.
 
Improving Enterprises
16633 Dallas Pkwy #100 Addison, TX 75001
Food and drinks will be provided. BYOB.

*****THE DOOR MAY BE LOCKED*****
The business that hosts us closes at 5PM, but there is a guard that comes by on tour several times per hour and will open the door. One of the organizers will be checking the door on a regular basis as well so please do not be discouraged by a locked door.

Even though it isn’t required please consider an RSVP if you plan to attend so that I can get an accurate headcount for food. You can RSVP through either [Eventbrite](http://cryptopartydfw.eventbrite.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottjosh), or email me at josh [at] wtftacos [dot] com
