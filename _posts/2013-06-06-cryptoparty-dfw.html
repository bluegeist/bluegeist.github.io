Although we have known for some time now that the NSA is spying on EVERYONE we can finally prove it via <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order?guni=Network%20front:network-front%20full-width-1%20Breaking%20news%20ticker:Breaking%20news%20ticker%20%28editable%29:Position2" target="_blank">theguardian</a>.

Now more than ever its time for us to get together and learn to protect ourselves from this offensive violation of our civil liberties.

CryptoParty is a grassroots initiative to teach everyone about how to protect their rights and privacy in the digital age. Come out and join us. We try and meet monthly and have different topics. Bring your laptops, and feel free to ask questions.
