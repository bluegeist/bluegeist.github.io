This month we will be talking about GPG. GPG/PGP is an encyrption tool that you can use to encrypt your emails. We will have a small presentation and workshop to teach you how to install, use, and maintain. There will be a keysigning party afterwords so if you already have a Key make sure you bring your fingerprint with you.

Food and drinks will be provided. BYOB.

*****THE DOOR MAY BE LOCKED*****
The business that hosts us closes at 5PM, but there is a guard that comes by on tour several times per hour and will open the door. One of the organizers will be checking the door on a regular basis as well so please do not be discouraged by a locked door.

Even though it isnâ€™t required please consider an RSVP if you plan to attend so that I can get an accurate headcount for food. You can RSVP through either [Eventbrite](http://cryptopartydfw.eventbrite.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottjosh), or email me at josh [at] wtftacos [dot] com
