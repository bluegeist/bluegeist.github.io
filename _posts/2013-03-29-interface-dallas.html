I will be giving a talk at <a href="http://www.interfacetour.com/dallas-texas.html" target="_blank">Interface Dallas</a> on May 10th entitled "Your Sysadmin got hit by a bus. Now what?" Come out and see me as I tell the tale of a former employer who put all their IT eggs in a single basket. And then that basket called the owner a name and ran away. I will give real world examples and advice on what to do if you are suddenly found Sysadmin-less and have no backup. And how to prepare for the possibility of this happening to your organization.
