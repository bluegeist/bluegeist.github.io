So in addition to abandoning Wordpress I have gone and moved the site over to GitHub and moved registrars as well. For those of you that were trying to email me during the downtime I apologize for the downtime. 

There are still a few things to do I still need to. I am working on importing the archives and creating dedicated pages. If you have suggestions for the site or general feedback please contact me and let me know.

Thanks
