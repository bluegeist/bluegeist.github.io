This month's topic is OTR. OTR (Off The Record) chat allows secure private communications between 2 or more parties. This month we have a guest speaker that will be talking about OTR. As always CryptoParty is free and open to anybody interested in learning to protect themselves. Feel free to bring your laptops or mobile devices. There will be free food and drink, BYOB.

Even though it isn't required please consider an RSVP if you plan to attend so that I can get an accurate headcount for food.
