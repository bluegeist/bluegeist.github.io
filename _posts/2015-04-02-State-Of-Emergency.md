On April 1st, 2015 President Barack Obama issued a new executive order declaring "a national emergency". [Link here to whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/01/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-engaging-significant-m)

In this latest expansion of the powers of the president he grants authority to the US Treasury to "block" assets of those deemed to be engaged in "directly or indirectly, cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States. This language is troubling. what exactly constitues a cyber-enabled activity? How does one define indirectly engaged in? If I create a security tool that is then used by a foreign state sponsored hacker am I indirectly engaged in the cyber-enabled activities?

A little bit further down the order states that anyone that provides material or technological support to hackers will face such sanctions. Once again leading one to believe that if I were to create a new security auditing tool that a malicous actor uses to engage in infrastucture attacks against entities within the US that I would be subject to this blocking. 

Additionally there is language in the order that states that providing assistance to someone who is blocked is also a crime. Here again is troubling language. What does this mean for those of us who are engaged in prison support programs? What if I have a family member who is under such sanctions? Am I going to be targeted by this order if I provide them with a place to stay, some money to pay a bill or get some food? 

Lets look at Jeremy Hammond for a moment and think about this. Right now Jeremy Hammond is currently serving a sentence for hacks he performed against the US Security Intelligence firm Stratfor. [Link](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/15/jeremy-hammond-anonymous-hacker-sentenced) 

First lets think about the outcry from the US Intelligence community when the leaks from Edward Snowden first started coming out. They claimed that the information being leaked was directly aiding our enemies, making terrorists smarter and harder to catch, and ultimately weakening the security of the United States. If you apply that same (flawed, faulty, and misleading) logic to the Jeremy Hammond case, then the argument could be made that he aided those located outside the united states and was engaged in cyber-enabled activities. Therefore he is subject to having his assets siezed. Any developers of the tools he used during his hacking escapades would therefor be subject to this same blocking, and right now anybody donating to his jail support fund would be subject as well.

The implications around this order are staggering. There is an official blogpost available that explains that the purpose of this law is not to attack those within the United States. They wont go after people who happen to be victims of botnets and have their computers participating in a DDOS attack. Nor do they plan on going after security researchers. Even if that turns out to be true, what about the next administration? We have already witnessed laws being turned and twisted to suit the governments plans, if you need an example look no further than [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) his persecution under the awful CFAA ultimately caused him to commit suicide. 

What else could come under the crossfire here? Tor? Tor can be used to hide where an attack is coming from. How about legitimate security auditing tools like vulnerability scanners or port scans? How long before just carrying a laptop with Metasploit is enough to get you thrown in jail for a few months or years?

**BEGIN PARANOID RANT**

I fear that this is just the start of a trend to take Information Security out of the hands of the public and put it in the hands of the military industrial complex. Is this their way of putting a chill effect on those of us crying foul at government surveillance, undermining their attempts to put backdoors into anything they want? Thanks to the persecution of [Barrett Brown](http://www.thenation.com/article/174851/strange-case-barrett-brown) a chilling effect has already begun in the journalist community with [Quinn Norton](https://medium.com/message/we-should-all-step-back-from-security-journalism-e474cd67e2fa?source=latest) How long before Information Security work is only in the hands of those specifically deemed worthy by the US Government?

I don't know how this will play out. I hope my fears aren't justified. I hope that I am wrong and they just use this to freeze some assets of some carders in Russia. But I don't have any faith in the ethics or integrity of the leaders of the US anymore. I lost that long ago.
