The February CryptoParty will be held on February 20th, at 7 PM at Improving Enterprises in Addison, TX. This month will be a review of the 4 most common tools taught at CryptoParty. Tor, TrueCrypt, PGP, and OTR. This will be a faced placed overview with more emphasis on the hands on portions than on the lecture. Bring your laptops, cell phones, and questions. This will be a very interactive class, and attendees will get more benefit if they interact and ask questions.
