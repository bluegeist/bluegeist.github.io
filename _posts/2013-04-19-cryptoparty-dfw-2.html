Thanks for everybody that came out. Several people have told me that they were unable to get into the building because the guard wasn't there to let them in. I want to apologize for that and I will do what I can to see that it doesn't happen again.

Secondly I wan't to apologize for leaving so early and quickly. My daughter fell and injured her arm, which turned out to be broken so I had to leave to help out with her at the hospital.

Here is the slides in both .odp format and .pdf format.
